Eat Poop You Cat is a bit like telephone meets that one game where you try to get folks to guess the drawing.

You start with a sentence pass it to the next person and it they draw a picture. Then they pass it to the next person and they can only see the last entry (picture in this case) and they write a sentence. It goes on until everyone has had a turn or boredom takes hold.
